My objective to learn Devops is that it has  been necesary topic in IT industry  to break the huge traditioanal monolith into simple addressible componenets . The software development which follows the SDLC methodogy is now transformed to agile way of development and delivery . This gave birth to CI/CD concept where there was maojor issue in longer time to for concept to productisation . This concept of Continouus delivery and Continous Improvements and the praciticality of the same.
