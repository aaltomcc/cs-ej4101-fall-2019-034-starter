My objective to learn Devops is that it has been necessary topic in IT industry to break the huge traditional monolith into simple addressable components. In any Development and operation teams are separate entities, Changes are accumulated into large batches before getting into production. It undergoes various types of testing and it is tested for full integrations. A long time generally elapses between the development and the deployment of a feature and generally it takes a lot time from concept to rollout. So learning the culture of dev-ops is critical change required for business. It requires a culture change and approach to drive the devops way of thinking in the organisation .This fundamental change is a key to enabling a high-performance organization.

The software development which follows the SDLC methodology is now transformed to agile way of development and delivery. Automating the testing and how does it integrates to delivery without human intervention. This gave birth to CI/CD concept where there was major issue in longer time to for concept to productisation. This concept of Continuous delivery and Continuous Improvements and the practicality of the same. This involves systematic process approach to cater to development and production. I want to know who various practical approaches how dev-ops is implemented using automation and technology angle to it .

There are various non IT practices similar to Devops like Kaizen and Lean and its comparison and analogy will be useful to perfectly implement the same. On the technology aspect, usage of Git is an important aspect as it is being used various organisation and an overview as essential to get this done.

# Learning

 First and foremost, the videos of David Mangot is like an encyclopaedia to keep referring to . The analogy for Kaizen being Toyota is really famous for doing this as part of what they call The Improvement Kata, it is something that they teach their employees. and everybody is encouraged to contribute to the idea of making the company better. The feedback loops, systems thinking approach gives a good overview of overall scheme of things in Deveops. CAMS model is good reference to explain the traditional IT folks and the customers who wants to see value which explains the start till the end approach.  Culture Â© which aims at bring in unity among teams , Automation (A) which aims at building systems without human errors , Measurement(M) is needed to monitor and track all the devops Environment and Sharing (S) which sharing the best tools, discoveries, and knowledge among teams just summarises are CAMS model The last part of future steps on devops with focus on security and quality engineering, compliance, Sales marketing gives a thought provoking ideas to implement.

Importance of cross functional team and it was a revelation that in a cross-functional team, we can virtually eliminate hand-offs as the roles are virtually present in the team so hand-offs does not exist all.         Technology is important but more than tools, they are completely integrated with culture and business. We look at destructive testing and how to incorporate it into the culture and help in software development. Container was an important topic and it was necessary to know how to choose between containers and configuration management. Importance of learning review and tracking the error to avoid repeating the same. Overview of tools like vagrant for configuration and Graphite for measurement was very unique and gave a practical overview of the same. Also last but not the least, configuring GitHub and knowing the way execute commands to push the codes.
